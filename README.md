# Power BI Dashboards

This folder contains different Power BI projects for a number of domains. Each project serves a specific purpose and provides valuable insights into different aspects of  businesses.

## Project 1: Budget Forecast Dashboard

The Budget Forecast Dashboard is designed to provide an interactive visualization of the budget versus forecast for an organization. It offers a comprehensive view of the budget allocation across different departments or cost elements, allowing stakeholders to monitor and analyze budget performance. The dashboard incorporates various charts, graphs, decomposition trees, and KPIs to highlight key budget metrics, trends, and variances. Users can interact with the dashboard to drill down into specific departments, time periods, or regions for deeper analysis.

### Features
- Overview of budget allocation across departments or cost element groups
- Visual representation of budget performance and variances
- Interactive filters for department, time period, and region analysis
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) to track budget targets and actuals
- Trend analysis and forecasting capabilities

The Budget Forecast Dashboard provides a holistic view of budget management by comparing the actual budget allocations with the forecasted amounts. It allows stakeholders to identify potential deviations or discrepancies between the planned budget and the actual performance. With the inclusion of decomposition trees, users can gain insights into the contributing factors behind budget variances, enabling informed decision-making and corrective actions.

Moreover, the dashboard offers running totals to track cumulative budget spending over time, providing a historical perspective on expenditure patterns and trends. This feature allows users to monitor budget utilization and identify areas where adjustments may be needed to align with the forecasted values.

## Project 2: Hospitality Sales Dashboard

The Hospitality Sales Dashboard focuses on analyzing sales performance in the hospitality industry. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for monitoring key sales metrics, identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions. The dashboard integrates data from a customer database (CSV file can be found in the directory), to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance across different dimensions, such as regions, booking platforms, room categories, and week-on-week analysis. With interactive visualizations and detailed insights, stakeholders can explore sales patterns, identify growth opportunities, and optimize revenue generation strategies.

### Features
- Sales performance overview by region, room type, and booking platform
- Comparative analysis of sales metrics and trends
- Week-on-week analysis of revenue, RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights), occupancy, ADR (Average Daily Rate), realization, DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights), and DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)

The Hospitality Sales Dashboard allows users to examine sales performance in the hospitality industry by providing a detailed breakdown of sales metrics across various dimensions. It enables stakeholders to identify top-performing regions, analyze the revenue generated from different room types and booking platforms, and track week-on-week trends for key performance indicators.

With the inclusion of week-on-week analysis, users can monitor the progress of revenue, RevPAR, DSRN, occupancy, ADR, and realization over time. This feature provides insights into short-term trends and helps identify any significant changes in sales performance, allowing stakeholders to make timely decisions and adjustments to their revenue generation strategies.
